Hi, This is a game named Lucid

Im gonna provide a Mac package and a windows executable.¨

if youre gonna use the mac version i cant pay 100€ a month to sign and notarize my app so you just have to:
 1. run the app
 2. ignore the "spooky" warning
 3. go to settings/Privacy and security
 4. scroll down
 5. click open anyway
 6. and put your password*
 7. thats it
